## A Personal Solution for Balancing Tasks and Mental Health
As a college student *juggling academics and organization responsibilities*, I often feel overwhelmed, and it affects my mental health. While tools like Google Calendar help us manage tasks, we often forget to track our mood.

That’s why I created Schedwell, a website designed to help you manage both your schedule and mental wellness. It allows you to track your *tasks, mood, and stress levels*, ensuring your mental health isn’t left behind.
The colors, violet and pink, were carefully chosen for their calming effects, based on research that shows these shades promote tranquility.

### Schedwell is here to help you "Schedule Well" and maintain balance in your life.
